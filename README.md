If you are interested to contribute, feel free to open a PR with a link to the course. It will take a bit of time, but I have plans to do many things with these individual lectures. We can summarize the lectures, include notes, provide additional reading material, include difficulty of content, etc.

You can now find ML Course notes [here](https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Course-Notes).
